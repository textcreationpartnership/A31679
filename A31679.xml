            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Preface.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE following Treatiſe thus undreſſed, was put into mine hands neare Twenty yeares ſince (by the very Reverend, Learned, and grave Author) to be privately uſed by mee, as by ſome other of his friends, of whom he was not aſhamed to be ſeen <hi>thus:</hi> and to whoſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity he yeelded ſo to <hi>liſp.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So exemplarily modeſt, and yet ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly exact hee was, that hee liked not to be much in ſight of a cenſorious world, though he merited as little ill from any, as he meant, which is no other than love and all Chriſtian offices.</p>
            <p>If notwithſtanding hee pleaſed to bee publick, hee would come forth (never in
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:99771:3"/>phantaſticall affectation, but) in ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall comelineſſe.</p>
            <p>And thus ſhould theſe <hi>bones</hi> of his have appeared, if hee had pleaſed to fulfill them; and happily more, or fewer.</p>
            <p>Yet as they are, they may be known to whom they once belonged: And very many will call him gladly to minde, though I name him not.</p>
            <p>Shortly, though the excellent Author intended it (perhaps) never to ſee the wide world, the Atheiſticall wicked world, the world that ſcorns the Theme of his Notes, the H. Scripture, and by ſcattering words <hi>[that men doe, or may make it an Idol]</hi> expoſeth it, and God withall, to the vulgar, hate, contempt, and worſe: Yet it were, I ſuppofe, ſome injuſtice to the dead, great injurie to the living, and a ſpice of Sacriledge (beſides ungratefulneſſe) in me, to ſteal, in a ſort, by concealing to my ſelf this <hi>thing,</hi> but thus much devoted to the Church, or beſtowed upon Church-men.</p>
            <p>I have therefore (with Gods approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and motion, I hope) endeavoured to do the Author and poſterity this <hi>right,</hi> after my ſmall ability, as not to deprive them of the great fruit they may, with me,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:99771:3"/>and ſome others, reap from this labour; nor Him of the publick improvement of this his Talent, as it is.</p>
            <p>And I have the rather been ſo rude with my once very reverend friend, leſt ſome other ſhould (for I hear that his papers are enquired for abroad, to benefit the publick, as they are) put this ſcorn upon me, that any man ſhould be readyer than my ſelf, to bear blame for ſo deſerving a friend.</p>
            <p>One thing onely ſeemed to remain of the Text, the ground of the Diſcourſe, though nothing of the Work deſigned by the Author; who in declaring the every good uſe of holy Scripture according to Art and Method, in uſefull Notes, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the hither-end of that, whereof the further end is, Gods glory (whoſe Word he ſo commends) joyned with our neighbour-mans ſalvation.</p>
            <p>That of the Text which ſeemed to me preſuppoſed by the Author, and not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed, I thought was left for ſome other, and (ſince none other will) it ſeems for mee.</p>
            <p>The H. Apoſtle in the former part of the Chapter 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. deſcribeth the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety of the laſt times, propounding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:99771:4"/>his doctrine, manners, and ſufferings to <hi>Timothy, and all that would live godly in Chriſts Jeſus,</hi> for an example; in the 14 <hi>v.</hi> exhorts <hi>Timothy</hi> to continue in the things which he had learned, and was aſſured of; and that from his knowledge both of the perſon from whom hee learned them, <hi>viz.</hi> the Apoſtle, a man inſpired by God, and of the holy Scriptures which are commended <hi>v.</hi> 15. from their ability or power of making a man wiſe unto ſalvation through faith in Chriſt. Which his knowledge of the Scriptures, is illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated from its duration in partie to <hi>Timothy</hi>'s age. From a child (ſaith the Apoſtle) thou haſt knowne the holy Scriptures.</p>
            <p>In theſe two laſt verſes 16, &amp; 17. hee aſcends from the <hi>hypotheſis,</hi> or ſpeciall, to the <hi>theſis,</hi> or generall, commending the H. Scrip. From their Author God, <hi>who gave them by inſpiration:</hi> and from their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit or uſefulneſſe in the reſt of the text, the 16 <hi>v.</hi> (which is the matter of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Treatiſe, as is the former of this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face) which profit is illuſtrated from a certain end thereof, 17. <hi>v.</hi> that the man of God may be perfect, throughly furniſhed to all good works.</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:99771:4"/>
            <p>But ere I proceed it is requiſite that it be ſhewed what is their cohaerence and uſe in the Body of Divinity, the Truth,
<note place="margin">1 Tim 6 3 Tit. 1.1.</note> or Doctrine, according to godlineſſe.</p>
            <p>And thus it ſeems to mee to ſtand.</p>
            <p>That God our Lord decreed from all aeternity to exert and communicate his goodneſſe abroad, and in the fulneſſe of time according thereunto hee performed his determination. <hi>Quaecunque voluit fecit,
<note place="margin">Pſa. 135.6.</note> Whatſoever the LORD would, he did, in the Heavens, in the Earth, in the Sea, and in all deep places,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt. That moſt ſingle, pure, incorporeall act the LORD reſolved to make a Creature like (not equall) to himſelfe. Therefore the firſt Creature he is beleeved to have made, was after his own image, ſpirituall, to wit, the Angels; and ſo laſt, the ſoul of man; which at firſt hee breathed into our Grandfather <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſtill goes on, working hitherto, by a con-naturall act, to increate, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate into bodies, receptacles prepared for it. God and man propagate mankinde, who are one part the Image of God, that is, in the ſoul, the other part the body, in the Image of Man.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:99771:5"/>
            <p>To give to <hi>Adam</hi> and to us his race only being without activity or power of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, had been to ſmall purpoſe; therefore he made us active creatures, and that with an higher extent of activity then the <hi>Horſe</hi> and <hi>Mule</hi> who have no underſtanding, even Reaſon and Will: though man being in honour underſtood not (as hee might,) but became (through his fault) like the beaſt that periſheth.</p>
            <p>Now this Reaſon and Will had been in vain, if it had no end to aim at, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God, his Creatours glory, nor its own happineſſe. Power of choiſe had been rather a burthen, yea, a curſe, than an eaſe or bleſſing, had there been no rule, no good means leading to this end, which means men ought to chooſe, refuſing the contrary: Therefore God preſcribed a Religion, or manner of Service, whereby hee would bee beleeved and worſhipped. This Service or Religion had been in vain, unleſſe it had been either written, and imprinted in our hearts, as it was in <hi>Adams,</hi> or elſe written and printed in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and legible characters to be read of every man, as (the Lord be bleſſed) it is in our Bibles, propagated and continued by good hands, through the power and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:99771:5"/>goodneſſe of God, from Father to Son, from Predeceſſors to Poſterity, to our time, and wee truſt will be to the worlds end.</p>
            <p>More fully and diſtinctly, take it, if you pleaſe, thus.</p>
            <p>Wee have received from God a reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſoul, after his image, and capable of him. An underſtanding fit to reflect upon our Creatour, and, in our meaſure, behold his glorious Nature, a naturall and inbred deſire of enjoying God, and reſtleſſe (if not ſome way beſotted till it come unto him.</p>
            <p>Now if God (as Heathen Philoſophers could obſerve) have, even in inferiour Creatures put no power, ability, or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall deſire in vain; how then ſhall wee imagine that in man, the abridgment or brief module of the world, the lively Image of God, for whoſe Creation there was, as it were, a <hi>Councell</hi> called in Heaven, <hi>Come let us make Man;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 1.</note> God ſhould in vain place a nature not perfectible without Him? But all this have we received in vain, if God ſhall not reveal himſelf, and the things of God unto us.</p>
            <pb n="8" facs="tcp:99771:6"/>
            <p>For it is impoſſible God ſhould bee known or enjoyed by any, but to whom he ſhall manifeſt himſelf, (who, as he is the beatificall object, ſo is hee the ſole Author of the acts of ſeeing and injoying himſelf, and all other in order thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to) or any thing be effectually beleeved concerning him, whereof himſelf, who onely knowes himſelfe, hath not teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
            <p>And howſoever by the Creation of the World, God hath ſomewhat manifeſted himſelf; yet could that never have ſatisfied mans ſoul in innocency, much leſſe now after the Fall; ſince when, unleſſe God had graciouſly given Revelation, wee were prone to abuſe that of him, which ſhineth in his works, as may appear by the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens fooliſh conceits of God, and more in the Treatiſe following.</p>
            <p>Moreover, alas! we could never have thought of Redemption by Chriſt, nor of Grace to be had, and obedience to bee yeelded here, nor of Glory to be inherited hereafter, no not by the help of all the Angels, had not God himſelf, who only knows his own will, revealed them. Of which you will find ſolid diſcourſe in the Book following.</p>
            <pb n="9" facs="tcp:99771:6"/>
            <p>And indeed it did not bſeem the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God, nor befit our condition, that we ſhould be the deviſers of worſhip for God: His wiſdome knows beſt what worſhip may beſeem us to doe unto him, and how to deviſe and preſcribe the ſame. It beſeems his Juſtice to be the Rule of that Worſhip, and his Will the enjoyner of it: ſeeing the very formality, or being of worſhip conſiſts in conformity or ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe to the Juſtice and Will of the party worſhipped, and his goodneſſe alone is to be the rewarder of it. Good reaſon hee ſhould reveal this, who is to puniſh omiſſion, and reward obedience.</p>
            <p>And though we were bound by the act of Creation, much more of Redemption, to worſhip him; yet did it not benefit us to pay this debt, till he ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe wherein. No though we could have deviſed fit worſhip: Much leſſe ſince the Fall, whereby we are ſo infatuated, and beſotted, and the worſhip now required challenging ſuch an height of knowledge, as Men and Angels never could have aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto.</p>
            <p>Finally, a man could never have peace of conſcience in any duty hee performed, except his Maker and Redeemers good
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:99771:7"/>pleaſure had been revealed unto him, and unleſs all the H. Scripture had been given by inſpiration from God; the Author gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it the Authority it juſtly chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lengeth.</p>
            <p>The Holy Gods words penned by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired Apoſtle, or Man of God, here, are</p>

            <p>My ſenſe is (with reverence to greater judgment, and readineſſe to ſubmit to better reaſons than yet I ſee, if it ſhall be thought wholeſome and ſeaſonable to produce them) that the word <hi>[Scripture]</hi> in this place is wrapped in two Tropes or Figurative expreſſions: Firſt, by a

            </p>
            <p>God hath alſo revealed himſelf to men by ſpeaking to them inwardly, ſometimes to their phanſie by dreams, 33 <hi>Job</hi> 14.5,

            <p>Laſtly, after a manner unſpeakable, God hath manifeſted himſelf to the minds of men, by dictating his Mind, and Will, and Word, to men choſen by him for that end. And this way of Revelation is called Inſpiration.</p>
            <p>Thus all holy Scripture is given by <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration of God,</hi> as we beleeve.</p>
            <p>And that upon ſuch arguments as are incomparably beyond all, brought in for
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:99771:9"/>evidence to beget belief of any other Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; and ſuch as to which nothing can be oppoſed to make them not to bee very credible. Which alone, if true, is a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient act on the propoſers part to beget (not knowledge which requires ſcientifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, and the more artificiall arguments, but) ſuch a Faith as the Motives or argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments thereof, are fit to perſwade, thoſe arguments coming in their ſeverall proper powers.</p>
            <p>This is a work which divers have had in hand, and brought to good paſſe, and it had ſucceeded better towards its high end but that the <hi>envious</hi> man will not endure any thing ſhall paſſe for an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment here, but one, the teſtimony of man, and that of none of the beſt friends of holy Scripture. Had not ſome of our own Divines decryed the Works of thoſe other learned men of ours, which they cannot aſſent to, becauſe their Intereſt ſayes they ſhall not, and herein aſſiſted the adverſary brought on his knees in the conflict, Gods word had found a freer paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, and more belief upon the ſame, and better grounds.</p>
            <p>The arguments made uſe of in this matter, are not all of one nature, ſome of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:99771:9"/>them more directly tending to win be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, that theſe are the writings derived to us by hands of very great note from the holy pen men thereof, &amp; the pureſt times: Others to gain and beget, with the holy Spirits efficacy in and with them ſuch a Faith, as (Intereſts, ſelf-love,
<note place="margin">Gal. 5.6. Heb. 11.33 Rom. 13.8. &amp;c. Gal. 5.14. Acts 15.9.26.18.</note> and ſuch other prejudices laid aſide) will work by love, will, in acceptable meaſure, work righteouſneſs, keep the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, purifying, and ſanctifying the heart (as holy Scripture ſpeakes) and overcoming the world is accompanied with Juſtification and Salvation,

            <p>An argument that will paſs among many Chriſtians, is the holy Scriptures Teſtimony concerning it ſelf, or properly Gods Teſtimony in holy Scripture con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it.

            <p>That God the Father, and J. Chriſt the Son, and holy Ghoſt, all bear record to holy Scripture, hath been ſubſtantially proved by others; and the ſame in effect lately,
<note place="margin">Dr. Ham. Reaſon. of Chriſt. Rel.</note> by a very pious, diligent, and learned Writer of our own, who doth all things like himſelfe.</p>
            <p>This proof, me thinks, cannot reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably be refuſed by the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> For why ſhould not the Scripture be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved teſtifying it ſelf to be Gods Word, at leaſt as well as they who (the greateſt

            <p>I deſire the Reader to peruſe theſe Texts and compare them, and I ſhall adde no more to this head.</p>

            <p>But if the Atheiſt will (as his irreligion ingages him) not accept this for a proof, ſince he cannot without manifeſt contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to himſelſe, both denie that God is, and affirm that he ſpeaks: Yet are we not deſtitute of ſuch proofs, as ſome apart, but more all together, will either convince him, or prove him a fool.</p>
            <p>Theſe tend either to beget humane or divine belief, according as they are.</p>
            <p>The former ſort ſpring from the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of man, which though it cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get divine belief, becauſe nor Faith, nor
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:99771:11"/>any other effect can riſe higher than the cauſe whence it proceeds, and in which it is founded; yet may it by Gods Order and Diſpenſation prepare a man to divine belief.</p>
            <p>And without doubt the Teſtimony of the Church was ſo evident authority to S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> no fool, that he muſt upon the credit of ſo many honeſt, knowing, wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaning men, beleeve this (or be fit to be hiſſed for an incredulous fool) that thoſe Scriptures on which they preached, and which they profeſſed, were the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginals, or elſe Copies of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or Writings of Inſpired men, moſt of them bearing their proper Authors name in their Front. Of which their Teſtimony they were able and ready to give exact account out of their Archives and Regiſters: ſo their predeceſſors upward till the Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>There are ſome witneſſes to part, (as Jews and Turks our profeſſed enemies, and therefore willingly teſtifying no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for us) and to all of it many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands Saints and Martyrs, no atrabiliary male-contents, but adviſedly reſolved, ſober Chriſtians, who have ſealed to the divine Truth in hand, and the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:99771:11"/>thereof otherwiſe, or with their deareſt bloud: and ſome of them ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſſed in the world, and wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to Gods glory and the peoples good;
<note place="margin">Exod. 32.32. Rom. 9.3.</note> that they could therefore have been content to have loſt their lives at leaſt, yea and their ſouls.</p>
            <p>This argument indeed from humane Teſtimony, can but prove that Jeſus our Saviour, the holy Apoſtles, &amp;c. ſpake or wrote theſe words; as ſome of them knew, the reſt beleeved.</p>
            <p>The other prove the Divinity thereof, and are together fit and ſufficient to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get divine belief, and they are ſuch as with divine authority have influence into the Heart of Man, and do build our Faith more immediately on Gods Truth, into which only, the beſt Faith muſt be analy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; no principle, to him that confeſſeth this to be truly affirmed of God (that he is a Spirit infinite in all perfection, and therefore in truth) being in it ſelf more evident than this concluſion is, (it is therefore ſurely true, becauſe God ſaies it.)</p>
            <p>Now Divine arguments are of two ſorts: Such as have power publick of convincing all men; or ſuch an one as
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:99771:12"/>hath ſtrength to convince and aſſure pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately, and that ſavingly, ſuch as reſiſt it not.</p>
            <p>Thoſe of the former ſort, are either ſuch outward actions of God about the holy Scriptures, as do ſtrongly argue that they came from him, as his ſigns, miracles and apparitions wonderfull, either ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of his preſence, or repreſentative of his perſon. The ſtrange light, the thick darkneſs, a private and publick, loud and ſtill voice, in a humane ſhape by his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, if not by his own Son as a <hi>Praeludium</hi> to his humanitie, which after he took in the truth of Incarnation. Theſe ſtrange things either were wrought by God (and then holy Scripture is his Word, who is ſo juſt and holy, that he would never have uſed them to confirm a doctrine falſe, or none of his) or elſe not wrought by him, and then 'tis the greateſt miracle of all, that the world without miracles ſhould believe a Doctrine ſo contrary to ſelf-love and worldly intereſt, that the wiſeſt Heathens, as they were ſhort in the degree of teaching and urging vertue, ſo they could in no kind once think of the proper Tenents and Inſtitutes of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity.</p>
            <pb n="21" facs="tcp:99771:12"/>
            <p>Or moreover, God hath done other deeds to prove the H. Scriptures to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of himſelf. Theſe are either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it, or by it.</p>
            <p>Concerning it: He hath kept it in all neceſſary particulars, both ſenſe and words unaltered, unmixt; ſo as his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, Wiſdome, and Power, ſo as his juſt Titles of Law-giver, King, Lord, Father, Juſt, mercifull Judge, require of him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides our neceſſity. And to doubt hereof, were ſo far forth to doubt whether we ſhould love and ſerve him, or indeed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that he is God, that is, infinite in all perfections. He hath kept it againſt ſo many great inroads and invaſions of the Devil and his inſtruments, a wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting world, and falſe Brethren, <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditores</hi> Traitors againſt it, in ſuch alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of times, and viciſſitude of affairs; though it croſſed the corrupt reaſon and affection of people ſoaked in Idolatry and ſinfull luſts, living at eaſe; whereas this Book, and Doctrine thereof was attended with the Croſs, and perſecution.</p>
            <p>By it God hath done ſtrange deeds; overthrown the kingdome of Satan ſo long and ſtrongly founded in the world,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:99771:13"/>ſtanding on the two main pillars of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils Oracles, and <hi>Daemons</hi> Idolatrie; and eſtabliſhed his own in the hearts of many millions, ſo deeply, as that they dare die for't; in ſo ſhort a time, that though Gods Word, without the efficacie of the holy Ghoſt, be a croſs to the mind, and fleſh, or ſenſuall appetite of man; and the Miniſters few, inferiour, infirm, (yet of undaunted courage) oppoſed by Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries ſubtile, powerfull, in authority, of contrary practice and profeſſion; and withall exaſperated with calamities which they imputed to Chriſtians and to the change of Religion: yet the work of their Converſion, and the fall of Satan was as quick as lightning.</p>
            <p>Now thoſe arguments proving the holy Scriptures divinity which God ſet or implanted therein, are conſidered ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Simply, or Comparatively one part with another.</p>
            <p>In the former are to be conſidered the kind of the Doctrine, and the phraſe of H. Writ.</p>
            <p>The Doctrine is propounded to man
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:99771:13"/>in Precepts, wherein not only the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and ſubſtance of duties, in themſelves holy, are injoyned (which argues the holineſſe of that God who commands them for our good) and are confidently preſcribed to be done by man, though croſſe to his fleſh and bloud, (which ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues Gods omnipotence) but alſo the manner of their performance is required to be out of conſcience, and love to God and our neighbours, without hypocriſie or impurity of the heart, which is known to God alone. Hence appears in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (as the former attributes of holineſs and omnipotence, ſo) omniſcience alſo.</p>
            <p>It comes to man moreover in promiſes and threats, which are ſo many Motives to man to obſerve the precepts to doe them, and can be fulfilled or executed on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by God, and available to move no man but the conſcience of ſuch as acknowledg the precepts to come from God. The au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of mans bare commandement depends upon the proveableneſs of its juſtice and equity: but the authority of Gods commands depends upon their power from God.</p>
            <p>Neither is it only propounded to man,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:99771:14"/>but alſo otherwiſe exerciſeth it ſelf about him, as in declaring and tendring ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity to the wicked, mercie to the Juſt, and the fit temperature of them both in Chriſt; ſo that although God dearly love his Creature, yet he will not be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led without a Mediatour, and him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſprinkled with his owne life-bloud, though he be his Son: whom indeed, having ſuffered, he will raiſe up, place at his right hand, make a King and Saviour to the ſons of men, Author of Salvation to all that obey him.</p>
            <p>Yea though God would have all men to be ſaved; yet he applyes powerfully the efficacie of his obedience and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to Beleevers and poenitent Sinners only, and to ſuch as by their obedience and ſufferings are, or are ready to be <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to the Image of his Son:</hi> And unto them he imparts a greater meaſure of glory than ever <hi>Adam</hi> in his beſt integrity was capable of, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſit on Chriſts own Throne with him, as Members with the Head.</p>
            <p>By the phraſe of Scripture, I mean not the concinnitic, and elegancie, and bravery of the flouriſh of the ſtyle, (though there want not ſome who dare with the Song
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:99771:14"/>of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Pſalm of <hi>David,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 33.

Thou ſhalt, thou ſhalt not, upon pain of evils here and in hell, or in hope of the promiſes of the life that now is, and (in heaven) that is to come. Here's the ſtyle.</p>
            <p>The Harmonie of one part with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is found by comparing the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines uttered and penned in ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of times and places by ſo many Writers: Of whom in the old Teſtament <hi>Iſaiah</hi> was ſawen to pieces by <hi>Manaſſch,

            <p>Moreover, by comparing the Figures w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> their Antitype, the ſhadow with its body. How fit a body was our <hi>Jeſus</hi> to their <hi>Iſaac,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 11.19.</note> whom <hi>Abraham</hi> received from the dead in a figure; to <hi>Sampſon,</hi> to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Jonah,</hi> and his other ſhadows!</p>
            <p>Adde hereto predictions or propheſies with their conform or anſwerable event, even in things moſt contingent, and often to mans reaſon, next impoſſible, and that long before.
<note place="margin">Iſ. 41.21, 22, 23.44.7.</note> Here is the finger of God without doubt. Which of the Heathen Gods ever yet anſwered the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah's</hi> challenge? Compare onely <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. <hi>v.</hi> 13, 14. with <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi> 40, 41. and wonder.</p>
            <p>The antiquity of H.

This
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:99771:15"/>is the Teſtimonie of the holy Ghoſt wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing this truth [that holy Scripture <hi>is given by inſpiration of God</hi>] which he doth by inlightning the mind to conceive it; by inlivening and ſtrengthening the heart with abilities to perform the commands therein contained, in expectation of the pretious promiſes, which the ſame holy Spirit convinceth the mind to be faithfull and true, and converts the will to count them good, worthy of all <hi>acceptation,</hi> and by his moſt powerfull grace (God only knows how) makes us (all worldly ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love laid aſide) relye upon the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus only for righteouſneſs and life; in the promiſes whereof the ſaid holy Spirit confirms and eſtabliſheth us,

            <p>In a word,

            <p>Let the 20. Article of our Engliſh Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, to which we formerly ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, ſpeak its mind.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Church hath power to decree Rites and Ceremonies, and authority in Controverſies of Faith; And yet it is not lawfull for the Church to ordain any thing that is contrary to Gods word written; neither may it ſo expound one place of Scripture, that it be repugnant to another.</hi> Wherefore although the Church be a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and keeper of holy Writ, yet (as it ought not to decree any thing againſt the ſame, ſo) beſides the ſame ought it not to inforce any thing to be believed for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of ſalvation.</p>
            <p>The 21. Article ſayes thus,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Generall Councels mvy erre, and ſometimes have erred, even in things pertaining unto God.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:99771:18"/>Wherefore things ordained by them, as neceſſary to ſalvation, have neither ſtrength nor authority,</hi> unleſſe it may be declared that they be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of holy Scripture.</p>
            <p>To theſe we heartily ſubſcribed as to points about the chief foundation of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation in Religion: The contrary aſſertion being the ſtrongeſt Hold and Caſtle of the errors we forſook.</p>
            <p>Who, after all this, dare diſpenſe with any ſtanding and fundamentall Canon in H. Writ? Who dare ſay, I man am above Gods word? when none but the Author can give authority of this ſort, as is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what too clear to need proving.</p>
            <p>And for my part, I dare not aſcribe ſuch <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, authentickneſs and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libilitie to the judgment of any men, be he preacher or private perſon (though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo wiſe or honeſt) as to give away the H. Scriptures prerogative, which it could receive from none but Gods In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration.</p>
            <p>If I ſhould believe any thing in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be true or falſe (whoever ſpoke it) upon a mans bare word, without expreſs Scripture, or good conſequence rightly deducible therefrom; I ſhould have cauſe to think, I had exchanged my Nature of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:99771:18"/>Man for that of Beaſts, who follow the Herd, not alwayes <hi>qua eundum,</hi> which way they ſhould, but <hi>qua itur,</hi> after the gang: or elſe good Religion for bad, to believe in man in ſtead of God: or elſe my reaſon with a Fool, to truſt another mans eyes, rather than mine own, in things I can well ſee.</p>
            <p>Never was there mere man alwaies free from error, God and his Word only are ſo true, as infallible. But all men are liers (ſo far as that poſſibly they may erre, and doe) ſaith the man inſpired by God; and that very ſentence was given by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration.</p>
            <p>It remains that I humbly deſire my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men to doe themſelves a favour or two.</p>
            <p>One is, to be as willing every word of Scripture ſhould be true and good, as men are, that the ſtories thereof (which little concern them) be true; and the promiſes thereof (which pleaſe them well) ſhould be good. Or I make it mine hearty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, that they be wel-pleaſed to believe the ſame of the precepts and threatnings of Divine Inſpiration in holy Scripture,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:99771:19"/>that they doe of the promiſes. <hi>i.e.</hi> That the thing in every of them propounded is good, therefore to be conſented to and imbraced, as well as the propoſition that carries it, is true, and to be firmly aſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto. This were a complete be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving.</p>
            <p>And all cauſe in the world, why I ſhould prevail. For God is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, The only wiſe (ſayes the Apoſtle) whoſe underſtanding is infinite. Therefore knows perfectly what he ſaies.
<note place="margin">Pſa. 147.5. Iſ. 49.7. Tit. 1.2. Heb. 6.18.</note> He is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and the Holy One of Iſrael <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> who cannot lie, not poſſibly.</p>
            <p>Beſides that we highly honour God the Author in believing his Word, thereby giving him the glory of his veracitie, the contrary whereof makes, <hi>i.e.</hi> counts him a lyar, or behaves it ſelf, as if it did. We ſhall reap the ſweet comfort thereof in the evill day, amidſt all aſſaults, and ſing, I know whom I truſted, God in his Word; God that cannot lie, who is faithfull and righteous in all his wayes and <hi>Chaſiadh</hi> good, kinde, holy in all his works, and in none more than this worke, his holy Word.</p>
            <p>And for my part, if I were certain any implicit Faith would ſerve my turne in
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:99771:19"/>all points, I durſt not venture on the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers round Faith, <hi>Quid credis? Fidem Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiae. Quid Eccleſia?

            <p>To this H. Scripture we muſt ſubmit our ſelves as to the high Law of the King of Kings, and Lord of all, even Lords. In ſo doing, God will reap the honour, we the benefit.</p>
            <p>There is one only requeſt to make to Scholars, Divines, who have their ſenſes exerciſed in the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>It is, that ſome one or more would ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther up the fragments, the jods and tittles of this inſpired Word, that nothing be loſt, and compile them in a Work to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
            <p>Plainly, Very many have taken great good pains in Commentaries, Gloſſes, Annotations. And of this laſt ſort (diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paraging none) <hi>Eraſmus, Beza, and Grotius,</hi> men of vaſt parts, all. Theſe, here and there, have gathered up the Adverbs, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions and Prepoſitions, &amp;c. and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily

            <p>That I may give an inſtance of my meaning, I put theſe few Quaeries, and they are no more, neither would I be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken, as if I at all intended to dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiſe.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> If ſin be compleatly repented of, and abſolutely pardoned by God, I ſee not how it can be a ground of reprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the partie: Yet in ſome caſes I think it may be reprehenſible, after it is truly repented of.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 If it be of that nature as requires an explicate repentance upon occaſion all a mans life. Thus God did more then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend <hi>David</hi> after his repentance, when he killed the child, and made the ſword not to depart from his houſe. But thus reprehenſion may be ſaid to look at thoſe future acts of repentance, by which the ſin paſt is not yet repented of.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 If the act have been very ſcandalous, and ſatisfaction not yet given, it may be reprehended to give ſatisfaction, that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant being not yet added to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; and ſo in ſome ſenſe it may be ſaid not to be ſo repented of, as that
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:99771:50"/>ſatisfaction is given. Thus our Saviour may ſeem to have given <hi>Peter</hi> a ſecret re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion for his thrice denying him, by urging him (till he was <hi>grieved,</hi> ſaith the Text) to a threefold profeſſion of his love to him.
<note place="margin">Joh. 21.</note> Other caſes may, perhaps, be thought of, and yet ſtand with that, That <hi>ſin</hi> unrepented of, is the <hi>formalis ratio</hi> of the object of reprehenſion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We muſt know what act, or affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the heart Reprehenſion tends to excite and work upon.</p>
                  <p>There be four paſſions in the ſoul of man, which be called by the School the <hi>Cardinales paſſiones,</hi> becauſe thewhole frame of mans heart moves upon them; the two firſt looking at the <hi>preſent;</hi> the two latter at the <hi>future;</hi> and theſe are <hi>grief, joy, hope,</hi> and <hi>fear:</hi> the two firſt in the <hi>conceupiſcible;</hi> the two latter in the <hi>iraſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi> Upon the two former of theſe doth the Apoſtles <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

                     </gap> here act, for the rectifying of the diſtempered ſoul: and in this act of Reprehenſion, upon the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>grief,</hi> to excite that to exerciſe it ſelf about the thing for which it repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends. This is manifeſt, where <hi>S. Paul.</hi> reprehends the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and then addes, <hi>Ye are puffed up,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5.</note> and have not rather mourned.</hi>
                     <pb n="97" facs="tcp:99771:50"/>And ſpeaking of the ſame matter,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>Ye were made ſorry by my Epiſtle after a godly manner, and godly ſorrow leadeth unto repentance not to be repented of.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the <hi>formalis ratio of the object of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion</hi> being ſin <hi>unrepented of;</hi> Gods word by ſtirring up this affection of <hi>grief,</hi> or working godly ſorrow for it, makes it to be no longer ſin unrepented of, and repentance cauſeth the ſinner to forſake his ſin (as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>He that confeſſeth and forſakes his ſin ſhall find mercy:</hi>) and God, in mercie, takes away the ſin (as <hi>Nathan</hi> ſaid to <hi>David</hi>) God hath taken away thy ſin. And thus the <hi>formalis ratio</hi> of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of <hi>Reprehenſion</hi> being gone, the ſoul is rectified, or reſtored from the diſtemper ariſing from the preſence of ſin unrepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of, by exciting godly ſorrow for ſin in the heart.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 How Reprehenſion excites ſorrow for ſin unrepented of. This may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood from the nature of <hi>grief,</hi> whoſe object being <hi>malum praeſens,</hi> it is excited (as all affections are by their proper object in its proprietie preſented) by ſetting before it <hi>the evilneſſe of ſin,</hi> and <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence thereof to the heart.</hi> So that Reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion works by theſe two acts. 1 Of laying
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:99771:51"/>ſin to the guiltie heart in the <hi>evilneſſe</hi> of it. 2 Shewing that it is <hi>preſent</hi> to it, or lies upon it, as committed, and not removed.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the laying of ſin to the heart in the ilneſſe of it is done two wayes. 1 By ſhewing the <hi>inhoneſtum</hi> (diſhoneſty or diſhonour) of the ſin, in the croſſeneſs of it to Gods holy will and rule, with the ſeverall heads of aggravations (well worthy the ſtudie of a Divine, and the practicall conſideration of all.) 2 The <hi>inutile</hi> (unprofitableneſſe and miſchief) of it, in croſſeneſs to mans true good: where comes in to Reprehenſion the act of Commination, if need be, either in regard of the ſin, or radication of it in the partie.</p>
                  <p>The latter, to wit, the <hi>preſentneſſe of this evill,</hi> if need be, is to be manifeſted by ſuch Notes as argue the preſence of it. As <hi>Samuel</hi> reprehending <hi>Saul,</hi> ſhewed him the ilneſſe of his ſin;

                     <hi>Rebellion is as the ſin of Witchcraft, and ſtubbornneſſe is as iniquity and idolatry.</hi> So when <hi>Saul</hi> would not take notice of the preſence of his diſobedience upon him, he gives him a note of it, <hi>What means this bleating of ſheep,

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Though the tranſient act exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall paſſed away, yet all the ſins that ever a man did, and hath not truly repented of, are ſtill preſent unto him in the ſtain, in the diſpoſition of the ſoul to further ſins, as likewiſe in regard of God, in the guilt and curſe that lies from God upon the head of the impenitent ſinner, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he ſtands as liable to puniſhment every moment, and eſpecially at the <hi>great day of Account,</hi> as if they were all at that inſtant committed.</p>

                     <p>The truth of this matter paſt ages have given too ſufficient proof of.

This is a fault almoſt as ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall as the object of Reprehenſion. For where is the man that deſires to be repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved when he deſerves? That layes Gods Word impartially to his heart for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying of it, and intreats this as a ſpecial benefit at his friends hand to tell him plainly, and lay Gods Word home unto him, when he ſees any thing amiſſe with him? There is not the pooreſt in the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:99771:55"/>company, but will be at coſt to buy a Looking-glaſſe to ſee a ſpot in his face, that he may wipe it off; and none ſo careleſſe of his outward man, but will thank his friend that tells him of that which would make him be derided of men when he ſhould come among them. God offers a glaſſe for our ſoul to detect the ſpots thereof, which make men odious to him, his holy Angels, and Saints; yet can we ſuſtain to come into his preſence with ſpotted ſouls, yea even ſuch ſpots as reſt not in the heart only, but come <hi>ſub ſigno,</hi> (ſome manifeſtation thereof) to be viewed by Angels and Devils, to the joy of Satan, and grief of our Guardians the holy Angels, (if thoſe can joy, or theſe grieve:) yea, ſuch as eat through the veil of our bodie (as I may ſee) and appear to the eyes of men. Yet is a ſpot in the ſoul ſo much worſe, by how much the ſoul is better then the body. <hi>Et pretium pars haee corpore majus habet.</hi> And it is of greater price (could the Heathen man ſay) and ſo much more care to be had for the wiping it off, by how much the cenſure of God, and his holy Angels is more to be feared, then of all the men in the world.</p>

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:99771:56"/>comes home to them from God in his Word, will not receive it home, and let it have its whole work upon them for their reformation, will not <hi>totum telum in corpus recipere</hi> (as the accuſation was of <hi>Scaevola</hi>); They will do ſomewhat with <hi>Saul,</hi> reform ſome things with <hi>Herod</hi> at <hi>Johns</hi> preaching, but if it tends to rectifie their darling corruptions, ſtop it there.</p>
                     <p>The nature of a remedy or medicine is <hi>aut prodeſſe, aut obeſſe,</hi> (either to doe good or harm) but if a man takes but part of the <hi>doſis</hi> which a skilfull Phyſitian pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes, the eſſence of the medicine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in that indiviſible he preſcribes, and the operation following the eſſence; what can be expected but that it ſhould only irritate the humour, and not being able to expel it, leave nature weaker and the diſeaſe ſtronger. Thus will their caſe be who deal thus with that pretious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy of the ſoul, which God the moſt wiſe Phyſitian of the ſoul preſcribes in his word for the cure thereof.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Yet more, thoſe that pretend to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Gods word in this act of reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but let it not enter into their heart. Like as ſome of our Church-papiſts deal

                     <p>Thus to receive a reprehenſion is ſo far from rectifying the ſoul, that it provokes Gods anger the more againſt it, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p n="5">5 Thoſe that contemn or deſpiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof. I was thinking whether to reſerve this, or the other of hating reproof, for the laſt and higheſt degree of thoſe who
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:99771:57"/>are here to be reprehended; conſidering, 1 That the object of contempt is a little evill, which we account not ſo great as to draw our hatred or fear upon it: and 2 Thoſe that hate reproof, doe labour more to hinder the ſincere preaching of Gods Word, and to vex the Miniſters thereof, then thoſe who only contemn it, and with <hi>Gallio,</hi> care for none of theſe things.</p>
                     <p>But I find that an evill may be counted little two wayes:</p>
                     <p n="1">1 In its nature and croſſeneſs to our affection.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 In the power that goes with it to prevail againſt us: and ſo the contemner may inly hate the ill as much, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving it to have no power to enter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, contemns it.</p>
                     <p>Thus <hi>Goliah</hi> could not but conceive that <hi>David</hi> deſired to kill him, as well as if a Giant had come out againſt him; but in his pride he ſaw not how he could hurt him, and ſo (ſaith the Text) <hi>deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So that to deſpiſe reproof from Gods word, may involve hatred in it, as it lies croſſe to a mans luſts, and ſuperadde athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſme, as if Gods reproof were not able,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:99771:57"/>either to deprive him of his luſts, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn him for them.

                  <p>If the reall evill of pain, but of that ſort which, though in its nature ill, is by an over-powering of God made good, as of <hi>probatio,</hi> or <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

                     <hi>Count it all joy, my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, when ye fall into divers trialls. When men revile and perſecute you, and ſpeak all ill of you falſly for my ſake,</hi>

Yea though ſuch need not comfort in <hi>actu ſecundo</hi> (actually) in that for which they rejoice; yet the Word of God goes along with them in fitneſſe to comfort them, if they ſhould at any time be dejected, and in the mean while, ſpeaks all good to their ſouls.</p>
                  <p>If an apparent ill, whether of ſin, <label type="milestone">

<note place="margin">Gal. 5.</note> which is a work of the fleſh; cannot be revenged on him whom he hates; may not vie drinking in the Colledge hall, or the like: here, though there be grief, is no object of comfort. Thus ſinned thoſe in the Prophet, who grieved the Sabbaths were ſo long.

                  <p>Yea, here may be a ſin of the higheſt degree. I know not whether the Devill hath a greater ſin then this, that he ſo grieves, he can do God no greater diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
                  <p>Yet if a beleever out of weakneſſe of judgment, and tenderneſſe of conſcience ſhould grieve for ſome act which was not ill; here would be place for true comfort: yea, if one yet an unbeleever, but <hi>in fieri,</hi> and under the hand of Gods Spirit preparing him for his converſion ſhould grieve for ſomewhat, as a ſin which was none, he might ſo far receive comfort, as to take away his grief in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of that object. So if out of the love of himſelf ſubordinated to the love of God, he ſhould grieve for ſome apparent ill of pain, whether preſent indeed, or apprehended only; here is a ſubject of comfort.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 If more in either, there is work for
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:99771:65"/>comfort, yet with difference. The belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver doing ſo with that ingenuous grief that looks at God as his father by him offended; Chriſt as his Redeemer, and the Holy Spirit, who hath formerly ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken peace to his conſcience: there Gods Word gives preſent comfort. But the unbeleever, and by this work diſpoſed to converſion, however he may over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grieve in regard of the puniſhment, or with ſome ingenuous grief according to ſuch apprehenſion as he may have of God, and ſo far may be comforted, as that the ſin is pardonable, and he in the way to obtain pardon, yet muſt he be brought to the ſight of <hi>plenteous redemption</hi> which is with Chriſt, and his grief made thereby more ingenuous, that upon his ſaith in him who takes away the ſins of the World, he may receive the great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of heaven, which the Word affords to them who come <hi>weary</hi> and <hi>heavy-laden</hi> unto Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 If equall, here is matter of joy. <hi>Poeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens ſemper doleat</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Auſtin) &amp; de iſthoe dolore gaudeat;</hi> The penitent muſt always grieve, and rejoice for that grief.

Yet becauſe ſin is the ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent to all grief, and had it not been, man ſhould not have grieved; and the ſoul under godly ſorrow is not where it would be; here is an object of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>

                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:99771:66"/>

                  <p>From all theſe particulars we may gather thus much in generall, That though the object of <hi>comfort, properly,</hi> be one that <hi>mourns,</hi> yet ſome mourners are excepted herefrom.</p>

                  <p>And I doubt not but it would carry a great reſpect of good, and much comfort to a ſoul in hell, to be aſſured that after ten thouſand thouſand years it ſhould be annihilated.

                  <p>Hence may appear how comfort acts upon the dejected heart, <hi>viz.</hi> by affecting it with ſome joy upon the <hi>good preſent,</hi> either in the removall of the ill <hi>partly</hi> or <hi>wholly,</hi> under which it lies: or elſe by bringing in poſitive good, which may ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuſtain the heart againſt the ill, if it remain, or poſſeſſe the heart with liquid joy, if it be removed.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3 For the third, It is hence that the Scripture ſaith ſo often, <hi>The things that I command you. Whatſoever ye doe, doe to the glory of God.

                     <p>If any one ſhall ſay, that he can attend when he will, and his time is before him: Let me tell him, That God opened the heart of <hi>Lydia,</hi> and man hath not Gods power in his hand when pleaſeth him. <hi>To day if ye will hear his voice,

                  <p n="1">1 The Nature of Dehortation.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 <hi>Dehortation</hi> (as Exhortation) looks not at its object as determined by any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent qualification of good or ill, (as Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion and Conſolation did) but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently.</p>
                  <p>To the regenerate it ſaith,
<note place="margin">Heb. 3.18.</note> 
                     <hi>Take heed brethren, leſt there be in any of you, an evill heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To the unregenerate, <hi>Sirs,
<note place="margin">Acts. 14.15.</note>why do ye theſe things? We are alſo men and preach unto you, that you turn from theſe vanities.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Only it looks at the object in relation to the future, (as Exhortation doth) but with this difference; That exhortation reſpects the Object as capable of ſome <hi>fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture good,</hi> that it may excite thereto: De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:99771:90"/>as liable to ſome <hi>future ill,</hi> that it may deter from it.</p>
                  <p>May we not then dehort him, <label type="milestone">

                     </label> to whom evill is preſent?</p>
                  <p>If the evill be of pain, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                     </label> there is need ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Conſolation: If of ſin, of Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion: If of both, in vain do we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort him from what cannot be avoided: Yet may we dehort him to whom evill is preſent, not from the evill as it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, but as it may hereafter be preſent; and thus far forth it is <hi>future.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 The affection which Dehortation intends to ſtir up, is <hi>fear,</hi> oppoſed affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matively unto <hi>hope.</hi> For ſeeing Dehorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is from evill that we may flye it, and <hi>fear</hi> is the flight from <hi>ill,</hi> or the affection whereby we eſchew evill; neceſſary it is, that Dehortation ſtir up the act of <hi>fear.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3 How doth Dehortation ſtir up this affection.</p>
                  <p>For this we muſt underſtand what is the object of Fear, and how Dehortation preſents to the affection its object clothed with that <hi>formalis ratio.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The object of Fear, is <hi>malum magnum, imminens, vitabile:</hi> A great ill, imminent, poſſibly to be avoided.</p>
                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:99771:90"/>
                  <p>If the evill be not great in it ſelf,
<note place="margin">Jer. 49.15.</note> we deſpiſe it.</p>
                  <p>Imminent, imports <hi>abſens, propinquum, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duum,</hi> a thing abſent, yet near, and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult.</p>
                  <p>If it be preſent, we grieve.
<note place="margin">Job 14.22.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>If we apprehend it under a conceit of diſtance, it affects us little or not at all. <hi>They that put far away the evill day,
<note place="margin">Amos 6.3, 5, 6.</note> chant to the Viall, and drinke wine in bowls.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If it be near, and not difficult, it makes us not very ſolicitous. The Rulers of the people in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſaid,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 28.15.</note> 
                     <hi>When the overflowing ſcourge ſhall paſſe through, it ſhall not come unto us, for we have made lies our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, and under falſhood have we hid our ſelves.</hi>

                  <p>Hence in the former verſe he calls them <hi>ſcornful men.</hi> They ſcorned the threatnings of the Prophet, becauſe they thought they could ſhift well enough, and eaſily avoid the ill when it came, though they lived in the ſin that cauſed it.</p>
                  <p>If Dehortation for the moſt part be from ſin, <label type="milestone">

                  <p>That ſin cannot properly be feared is the Schoolmans ſaying, and therefore we will examine it.</p>
                  <p>In the body of the Article ye have this deciſion, with the reaſon of it, and a <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lepſis</hi> or anticipation of ſomewhat that might ſeem to croſſe the former.</p>

                     </label> is S. <hi>Auſtins</hi> ſaying. Underſtand it of actuall ſin, and I think it may go for current. For that which God affords, or is ready to afford no power to avoid, I think he wil not condemn a man.</p>
                  <p>But to anſwer to his reaſon.</p>
                  <p>Sin is in our power, or rather impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencie, and will, to commit it, (as wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full experience teacheth) but ſuvingly to
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:99771:91"/>avoid it, is not in our power or will, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then we have power from Gods free Grace, and our will be acted thereby: and if we oppoſe contumacie to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting grace, we ſhall never obtain his co-operating &amp; ſubſequent grace, which he affords not but to thoſe who yeeld up themſelves to the former, cauſing them alone ſavingly to avoid ſin, who pray, and watch, and mortifie their luſts, and avoid occaſions of ſinnings.

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:99771:92"/>that ill company hath great power to incline to ſin.</p>

                  <p>That which unavoided is deadly, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſavingly avoided but by Gods grace, hath a luſtfull and deceitfull heart from within to incline to it, the World, Satan and his Inſtruments from without; that is juſtly to be feared.</p>

                  <p>That which God commands us to watch and pray againſt, bids us take heed of, and exhort one another dayly that we be not hardened by it; That which the ſtrongeſt of Gods ſervants pray they may avoid; keep under their body, make a covenant for avoiding occaſions of; That which overthrows ſo many thouſands, and hath conquered Gods worthies; that ſure is juſtly to be feared.</p>

                  <p>They are uſed promiſcuouſly in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, where God forbids nothing which either hath not the <hi>ratio</hi> of ſin in its own nature, and therefore is forbidden; or from the precept backed with the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, by which it is made <hi>ill</hi> to us
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:99771:94"/>though in its own nature indifferent.</p>

How is the Scripture profitable for <hi>Dehortation?</hi> In the ſame manner and degree, as in the other acts thereof, ſo that without it no ſaving Dehortation can be made, but thereby through the grace of the H.

                  <p>By an induction of thoſe dehortations which are every where in Scripture.
